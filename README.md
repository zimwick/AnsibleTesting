This is a series of mini projects that I have ran through and tested using Ansible.

All these projects are using an AWS ubuntu server for the controller and a mix of centos and ubuntu for
the other servers that it is configuring.

Yes I know each project has exposed the pem file and ip addresses of the servers but this did not matter
for my testing as I have since deleted the environment.
